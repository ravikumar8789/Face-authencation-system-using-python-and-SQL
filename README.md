Face Authentication System using Python and SQL
Overview:
This project implements a robust Face Authentication System using Python and integrates it with a SQL database for secure user management. The system utilizes facial recognition technology to authenticate users, providing a seamless and secure access control mechanism.

Features:
Facial Recognition: Leveraging state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms for accurate and reliable user authentication.
SQL Database Integration: Storing user data securely in a SQL database, ensuring efficient user management and retrieval.
User Registration: Allows users to register their facial features for subsequent authentication.
Access Control: Granting access to authorized users based on facial recognition results.
Logging and Reporting: Comprehensive logging of authentication attempts and system activities, with reporting capabilities.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for implementing facial recognition algorithms and system logic.
OpenCV: Utilized for image processing and facial feature extraction.
SQL Database: Integrated for secure storage and retrieval of user data.
Logging and Reporting Tools: Implemented to track system activities and generate reports.
